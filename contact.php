		<p>Video games are meant to be fun. They are meant to be a way of passing time and enjoying yourself, or even a way of learning depending on the game. In the world nowadays, video games are a way of profitting for large companies, and the old connection between developer and gamer has been severed in favor money and publicity. I want to change that mentality back to how it was. I want to make games that are fun and exciting for the player, games that leave them begging for more. If you think you could use my kind of attitude around your workplace, or just want to talk about games, contact me through the links provided. A copy of my resume is also here. </p>
