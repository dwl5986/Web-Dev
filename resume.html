			<h1>Derek Lescarbeau</h1>
			<h2>Resume</h2>
				<p>Objective: To create and build games that leave people longing for more content, to have a community stand behind and support one of my games, and to have as much fun doing it as possible.</p>
			<h3>Experience in the Field</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>Java</li>
				<li>C#</li>
				<li>HTML and CSS</li>
				<li>Some PHP</li>
				</ul>
				<p>As only a first year student in the Game Design program at RIT, I have yet to get significant experience in the Game Development industry. I have some experience in coding different languages and have the basics of object-oriented programming down.</p>
			<h3>Job Experience</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>Sodexo Food Company</li>
				<li>Telemarketing for my Father</li>
				<li>Texas Roadhouse Kitchen Staff</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The experiences of working as a telemarketer and working in a restaurant kitchen have really trained me in how to properly communicate on the job. Between talking to people on the phone and working together with other employees of the kitchen, I have become good at cooperation and group work.</p>
