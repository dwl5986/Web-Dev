		<p>My name is Derek Lescarbeau and I am a student of the Rochester Institute of Technology. I study Game Design and Development and all I want to do with my career is make games. I want to make games that are fun and exciting for the player, games that leave them longing for more. I want people to feel connected to the games I make, with communities that play the games because they're fun above all other things. Games like Legend of Zelda and Super Mario are prime examples of these. I am new to the Game Design industry and am looking to dive in. A copy of my resume is here.</p>
